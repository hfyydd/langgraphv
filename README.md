# LangGraph Visualizer


LangGraph Visualizer is a powerful VS Code extension designed to simplify the visualization and manipulation of LangGraph structures. This tool provides an intuitive interface for creating, editing, and visualizing LangGraph files directly within your VS Code environment.

### Features

- **Interactive Graph Visualization**: Seamlessly view and interact with LangGraph structures in a visual format.
- **Real-time Updates**: Changes in your Python code are immediately reflected in the visual representation.
- **Graph Manipulation**: Add nodes, create connections, and modify your graph structure with ease.
- **Automatic Layout**: Organize your graph layout vertically or horizontally with a single click.
- **New Graph Template**: Quickly start new projects with a pre-configured graph template.
- **Python Integration**: Works directly with your `.py` files, parsing LangGraph structures automatically.

### Getting Started

1. Install the LangGraph Visualizer extension from the VS Code Marketplace.
2. Open a Python file containing a LangGraph structure.
3. Use the command palette (`Ctrl+Shift+P` or `Cmd+Shift+P`) and search for "Open LangGraph Visualizer" to launch the visualization.
4. Alternatively, use the "New LangGraph" command to create a new graph file from a template.

### Usage

- **Visualize Existing Graphs**: Open a Python file with a LangGraph structure and run the "Open LangGraph Visualizer" command.
- **Create New Graphs**: Use the "New LangGraph" command to generate a new file with a basic graph structure.
- **Edit Graphs**: Modify your graph visually or edit the Python code directly - changes are synced in real-time.
- **Rearrange Layout**: Use the "Vertical Layout" or "Horizontal Layout" buttons to reorganize your graph.
- **Add Nodes**: Click the "Add Node" button to insert new nodes into your graph.

### Requirements

- Visual Studio Code 1.60.0 or higher
- Python 3.7 or higher
